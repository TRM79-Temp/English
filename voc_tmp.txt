In the last year, the company has been under increasing pressure from <exmpl>competitors</exmpl>.
After a week long <exmpl>off-site</exmpl> brainstorming session over <exmpl>golf</exmpl>, the company <exmpl>executives</exmpl> think it’s time for a big innovation.
The executives decided that flying ducks is just what the simulator needs to blow away the other duck <exmpl>sim</exmpl> <exmpla>competitors</exmpla>.
<exmpl>Grasshopper</exmpl>, tell me what you have learned of the Object- Oriented ways.
Master, through inheritance all good things may be reused and so we will come to <exmpl>drastically</exmpl> cut development time like we <exmpla>swiftly</exmpla> cut bamboo in the woods.
A common <exmpl>misconception</exmpl>, <exmpla>Grasshopper</exmpla>, but it’s more <exmpla>subtle</exmpla> than that. You have much to learn...
There are some object oriented-principles that underlie the patterns, and knowing these will help you to <exmpl>cope</exmpl> when you can’t find a pattern that matches your problem.; A design guru thinks about how to create flexible designs that are maintainable and that can <exmpl>cope</exmpl> with change.
Patterns are <exmpl>proven</exmpl> object-oriented experience.
The weather station will be based on our patent pending WeatherData object, which tracks current weather conditions (temperature, <exmpl>humidity</exmpl>, and barometric <exmpla>pressure</exmpla>).
Duck is <exmpl>psyched</exmpl>... he’s on the list and is waiting with great <exmpla>anticipation</exmpla> for the next notification so he can get an int.
<exmpl>Strive</exmpl> for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
Overheard in the next <exmpl>cubicle</exmpl>...; <exmpl>Cubicle</exmpl> conversation
There’s so many different kinds of us Observers, there’s no way you can <exmpl>anticipate</exmpl> everything we need. ### see 'anticipation'
Don’t do it, you might <exmpl>regret</exmpl> it!
Open for extension and closed for modification? That sounds very <exmpl>contradictory</exmpl>. How can a design be both?
Let’s take a look at the class diagram, which is a little more <exmpl>revealing</exmpl> (on the next page we’ll look at the same structure applied to the <exmpla>beverage</exmpla> problem).
